# Phase

Feel the flow of time with Phase, the most beautiful theme for [Hexo].
This is a fork from the [original phase theme](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-theme-phase). You may find a demo [here](http://guilhaume.fr/blog/). The main changes are:
- Color is now green
- I added french language support
- I added polygons support into phasebeam.
- I added a shutdown timer with friction into phasebeam so that it does not keep moving and using CPU/GPU ressources.
- Removed controls in the gallery widget when only one image.

## Install

Execute the following command and modify `theme` in `_config.yml` to `phase-green`.

```
git clone git://github.com/guiohm/hexo-theme-phase-green.git themes/phase-green
```

## Update

Execute the following command to update the theme.

```
cd themes/phase-green
git pull
